            DISCOVER BRADFORD!!!1!

        <p>
            Laqueesha Guptani is our homosexual black reporter. 
            She likes dildos and fat niggers, though her parents still believe her to be a Methodist Christian. 
            Alas this has forced us to replace all images of her with random Muslims we found in Southeastern Bradford, so we implore you to imagine an obese black "woman" when looking at our images.
            <div id = nigga>
                These images were taken and edited by our 10 pound an hour intern, Mustafar Al-Ahmadi, who lives in Bradford anyway, meaning all rights are reserved to The Guardian News LLC.
                if you wish to use any of our images please suck a fat dick you fucking parasite. Take your own images like propah lad :-(
            </div>
            Strap on your seatbelt as she takes you on a journey through the most diverse city in Britain, boasting a Muslim population of an astounding 40% !!!!
            (our journalist was not actually able to visit Bradford due to budget cuts, all reasearch was done from her flat in central London)
